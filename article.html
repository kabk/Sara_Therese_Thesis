<h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
<b3>
<p>I believe that writing can be an important tool for understanding the discipline of graphic design. In this thesis, I will attempt to understand why there is almost no public debate on the subject in Norway. Active participation in criticism, not only from the inside but also from the outside of the profession, can lead to significant developments in the field. Anna Craemer wrote on her website about graphic design philosophy «The newspapers are full of criticism on art, literature, music, cinema, theatre, fashion, architecture, food and, sometimes, even product design. But there is very little writing on graphic design in the public press.» Is it because there is no interest among the readers, does it have to do with the general understanding of what graphic design is? Is there is a need for a debate on graphic design in public media?
</p>

<p>What determines the lack of coverage on graphic design in media? It could be a result of; the designers themselves, the projects they work on, the role of advertisement in media, the editors, the journalists, the lack of readers interests, etc., the list is long. Perhaps the answer is to be found in the political system, in the regulations on the use of public space? It might simply be that this topic is by, and for graphic designers only. Steven Heller wrote: “Maybe graphic design is just so ephemeral that serious criticism has no place. Maybe graphic design simply doesn’t warrant public interest. After all, not all fields and professions are so examined.” These are some of the questions I will be trying to answer.</p>

<p>To define the factors which affects the situation, this thesis is based on research from international graphic design history, theory and criticism, which is used to create a background for understanding the situation in Norwegian media. Interviews with Norwegian graphic design historians, journalists, architect critics and graphic design organisations will be used to set the international references into the context of graphic design criticism in Norway. By looking at the situation from different angles, attempting to narrow down what the causes are, I hope to find some possible solutions.</p>

<p>“Compared to art or film criticism, the term ‘graphic design criticism’ has an unfamiliar, slightly uncomfortable ring to it. It is one that even the most avid reader of graphic design magazines and books will encounter rarely, if at all”. This is how Rick Poynor described criticism of the graphic design profession. Graphic design criticism has been debated since the beginning of the 80’s. One of the first to call for it was Massimo Vignelli whom in the Keynote Address (1983) commented on the lack of engagement with the meaning of graphic design. Vignelli focused on the importance of criticism to show designers which direction to go in, because the time had come for designers to stop commenting only on the visual appearance of each others work, but to also start investigating why and how projects were made and what motivated them. «Without criticism we will never have a profession» he wrote, a statement that might be as valid today as it was back then. What he was calling for was the creation of a cultural structure for the graphic design profession, a structure that would be based on criticism, documentation, theory and technology.</p>

<p>In the years that have passed, graphic design criticism has been keenly debated, and quite often called for in articles written both by designers, historians and journalists. What happened to the criticism? Where did it go? If anything, it did not turn to the popular media. To be able to call for professional graphic design criticism, or even an amateur one, we need to define who it should be made for. And why it should be written, and what media or platform to use in the process of communication. Pierre Bernard wrote that “there is no single notion of an approach to what design is or should be: on the contrary, there is a whole panorama of notions and approaches” a comment that might well be used to enlighten the situation of graphic design criticism. It is a broad topic with many versions and variations of both in content and form. Criticism can be seen as the everyday reviews published in daily papers, telling people what they should or should not buy. It can be the semi-long articles about an art-piece, architectural project or about the design of a newly published book written by both journalists, designers, architects and historians. Or it can take the form of carefully executed research based critical works, often resulting in the shape of a book. The latter being academic, a piece of research, a collection or a history such as the book Graphic History In The Writing by Sara de Bondt & Catherine de Smet. A collection of graphic design history and criticism mostly read by graphic designers themselves.</p>

<p>What is the difference between theoretical, academic criticism and personal opinion (often found in daily papers)? How do we clarify these differences to create a climate where there is room for all of these approaches in daily papers? Hudson wrote that freedom lies in the multiplication of opportunities for making real choices – in judgement, in belief, in purpose, in action. He continued, saying that the “liberally educated person” has a wider choice of things to think about. If freedom is in the opportunity to make real choices, to judge, then the opinionated debate, in this case about graphic design, should arguably be available to all of the broader public. The question moves away from whether we need it or not, to a question of who should curate graphic design criticism, assuming that it needs a curator. Perhaps it does not. Should this be on the shoulders of designers themselves? Should there be a forum for design critique and design thinking such as KHiOs recently started, but not yet public, forum designkritikk.no? Or should we have an actual museum of design criticism led by a curator, a person who runs the discussion, and provides an overview. Perhaps the best approach would be to gather, and share. A collective brain is better than an independent one. So instead of a curator, what we would then need is a collector, an archiver who structures the debate taking place, and making it visible. The question that becomes important then would be: Who creates the criteria of graphic design criticism? Journalists, designers, academics?</p>

<h2>1.2 Graphic Design Criticism in the media </h2>
<br>

<p>In Norwegian media today there seems to be no existing structure for how graphic design criticism should be written. There is also no given platform on which it can exist. Often when a piece is written on design in public media, it is about product design. The writer taking on the role as a reviewer, who points out his or her opinion of strengths and weaknesses within the product. The review should be considered as a form of criticism, one that is also used to critique the graphic design of books. Books are easier to judge as products, than many other aspects of graphic design, because they have a function and a value that is apparent to the user. The review, as a text, is neither useless, nor a negative thing in itself, but this alone does not suffice to create a public awareness of the role of graphic design? I do not believe that this would be enough. Neither does Kristina Kreole Bore, a journalist with an MA in design writing criticism: “design critique is for me not only about these, kind of, ’reviews’ of something. Design critique can also happen in a written piece that is about looking at a specific tendency or development.”</p>

<p>There have been two noteworthy exceptions to the rule in recent Norwegian media. Firstly, the competition to redesign of the Norwegian national bank notes. This attracted national and international opinion both on a good vs. bad level, and in broader discussion regarding the aims and usage of the new designs. The second example was also a competition to redesign Norwegian passports. This time it did not receive the same level of international attention at first, and the interest in media seemed to die out until the international news picked up the thread, and Norwegian mass medias interest flared again. I will come back to these two examples throughout the text as they function as interesting introductions to what criticism in Norway today is considered to be, and what it has potential at becoming.</p>


<p>The mere fact that both of these cases were mentioned in mainstream media gives the projects a point in time, suggesting that these designs are indeed of importance to society. By doing so, this writes them into the Norwegian history of graphic design. Robin Kinross asked: “What then might design history be?”, is it only a collection of what we discuss and remember from media and books today. If this is true, it saddens me to say that the Norwegian history of graphic design will be very limited because much of what we might consider as ‘important’ today would then be forgotten. Kinross continued saying “I am inclined to suggest that the term be discarded in favour of ‘design criticism’ (‘design theory’ sounds too forbiddingly remote in our pragmatic context). The point is that history happens anyway, as soon as one starts to ground something in its time and place.” So in order to create a stronger graphic design history in Norway, we need to develop graphic design criticism. The reason is that graphic design criticism is the sole factor which pins the current situation down. The debate, the discussion, and the developments alike. What we put on the agenda today, might be what validates information on graphic design within a Norwegian context today, and in the future. As we can see in books dedicated to graphic design history, what is often reproduced and talked about is what becomes important milestones in the history of the profession. </p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>1.3 What is criticism?</h2>
<br>

<p>“It is interesting how one says ‘good work’. You have this awkward business of what the criteria of judgment are.” It is difficult to decide what good and bad graphic design is because, as mentioned here, we do not have a universal set of criteria to judge by. It is also difficult to determine what the term criticism means. In the English language there seems to be a better understanding of the word than in the Norwegian where the word kritikk has a bad connotation, often referring to the negative. Kristina Kreole Bore explained this to me: “In Norwegian, we tend to think of it as something that’s just negative, while critique is something that I believe actually has a positive viewpoint, or intention because it is about saying that there is something good about something, or that has the potential to be better because it is, in fact, substantial in some way. And in the more academic world, it’s just a given that having a critical mind-frame is something that you need to have to produce something good.” Martin Braaten, editor of Arkitektnytt also pointed at the different meaning of the word(s) in English and Norwegian: “they (ed. the english language) have the posh version, critique, with q, u, e.” The oxford dictionary describe critique as: A detailed analysis and assessment of something, especially a literary, philosophical, or political theory. The definition here referring to subjects which are clearly academic, perhaps not for mass media. I find it important to notice that it does not mention critical in the negative sense. Criticism in general is described as: The analysis and judgement of the merits and faults of a literary or artistic work. It is interesting that this definition also mentions merits. Judging what is positive, what is worthy. Adapting these definitions to graphic design criticism would mean to look at the project, at the context and the usage of it and analyse what was good, what needs to be drawn into attention, and what should be improved. Graphic design critique then would be a more academic analysis, a more in depth research about a project, or a situation, and the creation of a theory considering why it is what it is and what implications or benefits that might have.</p>

<p>Looking at the definition of the terms critique and criticism is one thing, understanding what most people read into these two terms is another. “Criticism,” one internationally renowned designer declared, “usually takes the form of the negative and the overly judgmental.” More often than not criticism is considered to have a negative connotation. Not so much in the world of art, literature, architecture, music and theatre criticism, but within design. To be critical is often connected with being judgemental. “To be judgmental is to wag a finger and raise the voice, to carp and repress. Called to account in such morally loaded terms, criticism can’t possibly be a good thing. But this is, in reality, a considerable misrepresentation of the critical process when responsibly carried out.” The oxford dictionary also wrote that criticism could mean the scholarly investigation of literary or historical texts to determine their origin or intended form. In the case of graphic design criticism it can be transferred to looking at the project / product to analyse what was the origin, what was the approach taken, what was the intention, how was it received and what is there to learn from it? </p>
<br>

<p2>“It is hardly the purpose of criticism to squash its subjects arbitrarily. On the other hand, being a critic does require the exercise of judgment based on all the writer’s knowledge and experience. The writer who wilfully suspends judgment, or fears to make it, lets down the reader and ultimately perhaps the subject itself. This critical process will often lead to conclusions at odds with those of the subject. But while the process might be intrinsically adversarial, it is not inherently negative even if the ordinary usage of the verb – to criticize – makes it sound as though it is. Criticism’s conclusions may be largely or even wholly supportive of the subject.”</p2>
<br>

<p>What Rick Poynor and Michael Rock try to narrow down here is the terminology problem, criticisms close connection to the verb criticise, which is often misunderstood as the meaning of criticism. Allan Lustig said “I don’t think it’s a question of good design or bad design!” It is not about pointing fingers, it is not about scanning projects for flaws and mistakes, though sometimes they should be mentioned. Well-written criticism can be done with the intention of calling into attention good projects that have not been seen, to encourage, to inspire, and yes, also to criticise in the strictest sense of the word. The latter is important as a constructive element in the development of new directions and ways of thinking within the profession. Anne Burdick wrote “Through discussion and review we are held accountable to our peers, and as a result words of praise carry greater weight. Constructive criticism should not be something we fear; it should be something we welcome.” Due to negative connotations to criticism in general Kristina Kreole Bore suggested another word, she focused on the word reflection in her MA because it is what she thought to be the starting point of any critique. Perhaps the first step to create an increased interest and debate around our profession would be to remove the negative connotations and do, as Bore did, skip the word. Another writer, Anna Craemer, whom I mentioned earlier in the text focuses on what she calls graphic design philosophy, without a doubt a tactical approach to open up for new ideas on what it should, and could, be defined as.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>1.4 Style of writing most often used, and why it is difficult to print serious criticism</h2>
<br>

<p2>“Ever since its inception graphic design has been above criticism. Not because it is inherently uncriticizable, but because designers have neither a critical vocabulary, nor the means to address work in a public forum.The majority of trade magazines showcase rather than analyze individual design. And while informal crits (teacher to student and client to designer) are routinely carried out in the privacy of a classroom or office, substantive criticism is rarely presented before a larger audience, no less a broader public.”</p2>
<br>

<p>Written pieces on the subject of design are often by journalists who have a lack of experience in the field, and it is rare that they have an opportunity to write more than a few articles on the same topic. This creates a situation where there is a lack of ‘educated’ writers. This is not to say every writer needs to have an education in the field of critical writing, but we need writers with an interest, with experience. Writers who are able to translate graphic design projects into an understandable topic for readers of the daily paper. Often when graphic design is mentioned in a digital Norwegian newspaper it is presented as an image slideshow instead of as an article. One example would be the competition hosted by Grafill, an organisation for the professions within visual communication, called Visuelt. Several years in a row the winners have been published online on dagbladet.no, a national newspaper, as an image gallery with one caption to fit all of the images. This becomes a visual reproduction solely about the aesthetic of the works in the competition. I would not go so far as to say this is wrong, but it could certainly be improved to include a more balanced presentation of the work, and more important what ideas lies behind the projects. This competition would be an opportunity for Norwegian media to take interest in the designers, in the profession, in the market, in the process and in the public reactions. By looking deeper into a competition such as Visuelt there would be availability for interviews, studio visits, articles, debate on content and visualisation and for questioning the production. Is it not interesting that most Norwegian books get their paper, their printing, their typefaces, their binding and so on abroad? Perhaps this is knowledge the daily papers are unaware of. In relation the previously mentioned example of the redesign of the Norwegian bank notes Aslak Gurholt Rønsen commented that most of the articles that were published on the competition, that was exhibited at Grafill, did not question much of the content in the designs. What these articles focused on he narrowed down to as “look at this cool Scandinavian design.” Certainly Norwegian graphic design needs the positive attention of international press, as a means to build up a national self confidence, but are we satisfied with this?</p>

<p>One reason why the articles on competitions such as Visuelt ends up as image series can be found in this quote from The Small Crit by Steven Heller: “As a record, competitions are valuable, but as criticism inclusion and exclusion is not the answer.” Perhaps these image galleries are representing exactly this, which works were included, nothing more, nothing less. Another reason can be that “Even mainstream journalists with a penchant for graphic design complain that aside from the incidental story about momentary fashionable graphic conceits, it is truly difficult to pitch and get accepted a serious article on graphic design as a cultural force, no less get a critical perspective into print.” Why should it be difficult to get an article on graphic design criticism published? During a symposium on the subject of design criticism, at KHiO (art college in Oslo) there was a discussion that raised the same question. Several journalists in the audience claimed that even though they were interested in writing more about design, even graphic design, their editors were not interested in publishing this kind of writing. This suggests that what Steven Heller brings to attention might also be the case in Norwegian papers. The question of why editors turn down this content can have many reasons, and most likely the answer is to be found in a combination of them. </p>

<p>Firstly, there is the situation where most printed magazines and daily papers in Norway today are dependent on advertisement as an important income. It is a situation where the advertisers, perhaps not directly, control the printed content. “Magazine editors have lost their editorial independence and work for committees of publishers (who work for committees of advertisers).” An example of this was how the previous editor of the Scandinavian design magazine Form mentioned that over a longer period of time, they had chosen not to publish critical articles. As a way to show respect to the design field, to the writers and to themselves as a design magazine, they collected these articles and published an edition that was dedicated to critical writing. As a result of this critical edition of Form, most of their big sponsors chose to withdraw. This story reasons the assumption that advertising and sponsorship plays an important part in the lack of graphic design criticism in daily papers and media today.</p>

<p>Secondly, among the editors of daily papers, and mass media, there seems to be a lack of faith in the readers interest and/or capabilities of understanding the topic. “Although recently the graphic design profession has had its share of coverage in the mass media, usually in the form of trendsetter profiles, but never have individual works been singled out for critique in the press in the same manner as a current exhibition, film, or for that matter, advertising campaigns.” Graphic design mentioned in newspapers seem to be sensation based, not considering so much the content of a project, rather showing of the successful creators. This way of angling a story on graphic design is probably easier to sell because it focuses on the people behind. It is feeding the curiosity of the reader. “I think we are always curious about how someone works. We are all a bit voyeuristic, so that is an easy way to tell a story. It is a problem in design writing, because the focus has shifted from the object to the person who produced it, who is usually part of a team.” Another sensation based way of writing that seems to be quite common in mass media, especially on internet, focusing on design with special effects. “It’s a very easy way to write about design because you can use these crazy events, like ’3D printing the moon!’ Or these ’bio-technologies that make your sneakers heal overnight!’. This kind of design journalism is becoming more and more used, and it’s a very easy way of communicating what something is but it doesn’t necessarily say that much about the field, or how it’s developing, apart from this crazy invention that someone’s done in the name of design.” It results in a black and white way of telling a story, a way of writing that removes the nuances which are important in the development of a critique.</p>

<p>“Editors are reluctant to risk alienating the very people who make up their subscription lists, or to commission or publish longer or more challenging pieces of writing.” was one of the comments in a conversation between Rick Poynor and Michael Rock. An interesting comment, and perhaps a true one. Elizabeth Ramsey, also focusing on alienating the reader, said that one of the deficiencies in the art world today is “the improper distribution of media coverage of all the different types of art, and how this alienates a lot of people from becoming interested in art.” Now we have a problem, it is a question of either alienating people from the subscription lists or alienating them from the interest in art or, in the case of this thesis, graphic design. “I think it is important to understand that only occasionally do new ideas generated in the academy make their way into the media – and thence into the popular realm. Unfortunately, as with its attitude to most things, the media tends to focus on the outlandish, since business-as-usual is not news.” Reflecting now on the outlandish, as Matt Soar puts writes, it could mean that what the media found interesting about both the redesign of the Passport and the Bank notes were not how and why they were made, as this is business-as-usual, but the fact that they were interesting to international media. Suddenly papers such as The Guardian had their eyes on Norway, on the capability of the Norwegian design community. Why would the readers not be interested in what it was that created the international awareness? Why did we have competitions to have these items re-designed in the first place? Bore said “what’s kind of interesting is the things where I am most critical are not the pieces that are published in Norway, it’s for international media.” She elaborated this, “There doesn’t seem to be a lot of room to do actual critiques of design in Norway, and there are several reasons for that I think. One thing is that to have that kind of critique in the media, it also needs to exist in the field, I believe.” Her view on the situation is suggesting that the problem is not necessarily the lack of the readers capabilities or interests, it is rooted within the profession of graphic design in Norway. “It can’t just be in the one place, it needs to be triggered and fuelled by something and so, when there are so little critical activities happening in the field itself, it doesn’t lend itself easily to write about it.” Meaning that for criticism, reflection or philosophy of graphic design to grow the profession itself needs to nurture it somehow. It needs to be made interesting for the field itself. However, it is very individual how graphic designers in Norway regard the state of things. While some clearly feel the lack of communication, discussion and development, others consider it to be a situation where we already have many good opportunities for this.</p>

<p>Thirdly, freelance articles on design criticism in general are periodical and not well categorised and organised, they are hard to keep track of and keep updated on. To be able to have a continuous debate there needs to be contributors to the discussion. “Occasional paper writing in the course of research is not the same as being a fully fledged critic, writing regularly about a broad range of graphic design subjects, or many different aspects of the same subject.” One of the reasons the writings on graphic design is so fragmented is because the contributors often are writing as a side-project. While devoting most of their time to other aspects of professional life, be that design, writing or something completely different. It is a situation where the people who write the criticism comes from many different backgrounds, though it is surprisingly few graphic designers who write themselves. Another problem is that most of the printed debate is written by  freelancers and therefor arrives periodically. That there is no (permanent) column, or space for it in public media, means that the writers don’t get to develop their personal language for writing. The vocabulary for voicing an interest, or a discussion, is limited. “Whatever the discipline, the critic is engaged in a process of interior and exterior discovery, a riskily public dialogue with the subject matter, the readership, and him or herself. Critical positions will inevitably evolve over time, Errors of judgment will sometimes be made. The critic can only learn what is possible by constantly writing.” Writing as everything else demands experience to develop. Serious film critics would be a good example for how graphic design criticism can evolve. Written discourse on film are often followed by readers, both from within and outside of the profession, with different levels of interest and knowledge. It has something to do with the approachability of film. Another problem that occurs due to fragmented design criticism in general, and graphic design criticism more specifically, is that important articles of interest for discussions are seldom followed up by interviews or replies. This leads to a situation where those of the readers who are interested in following up this content would have to do the gathering or collecting themselves. This assuming that there was a published article.</p>

<p>Lastly, “In the media the prevailing view is that design is a market- related phenomenon, if not a marketing tool.” If graphic design is considered as a part of the market, and the market sphere, then the cultural attention and the value it might have in the public space is diminished. Which then leads to a lack of interest in what is going on within the profession. Perhaps the view on graphic design as a marketing tool can be a direct result of graphic design (history) writing being by - and for graphic designers only. That the theory, the reasoning and research we work on does not reach the readers of daily papers. It reaches an inner circle of interested readers. It could be because of the lack of a publishing platform, but it can also be that the focus has been too much on ourselves and therefor uninteresting for others. “Searching for values, design looks in the visual places – inwards, never outward.” The ability to reach out to the public media, to say something about what graphic design does in the public domain, to justify. To explain by showing projects in context with what is going on in the rest of the society, in terms that the broader part of the public can understand, would contribute to both a renewed awareness around the profession as well as giving the fuel needed for graphic designers to understand what values they work for. “What should be self-evident by now is that talking about contemporary design practice draws us inevitably into a wider social discourse.” It is not possible to draw a clear division between what is related to the “inside” and “outside” of our profession. They are interrelated. Katherine McCoy said: “We have trained a profession that feels political or social concerns are either extraneous to our work or inappropriate” and “Design it not a neutral value-free process” For a long time there have been the idea that graphic design is work that can function along side of society, there is no need to get involved in the public debate. A lack of communication that might be the reason it is a profession often misunderstood by the general public as only functioning as an advertisement tool.  Though if we look at the history of graphic design, one can see that the periods in which it blossomed, and took form, often were periods of political turbulence. Periods where graphic design also took the role of opinion maker, of creating standards. I am not saying that there is one solution, the ideological road. Merely pointing to the fact that the profession is tightly knitted with the movements in society, and therefore I believe it needs to let society play a part in the development and trends of our work. “For me if we’re going to talk about design criticism, I think that it belongs in a bigger media than the trades, and that it needs to sit in the context of other cultural criticisms.”</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>1.5 Why graphic design criticism is important for the profession?</h2>
<br>
<p2>“Michel Focault´s investigations of the ways in which power operates in society tell us that power does not flow in one direction and simply operates its subjects in a negative way. Power, which can be positive or negative, is everywhere and if power is everywhere it can be addressed and disrupted everywhere. The fact that we are involved in the power structures we oppose does not negate opposition – it refocuses it. In each scenario, the individual needs to understand how power acts and through which methods. Rather than making individual voices feel lost in the mire, this empowers them because it means they can draw up their own knowledge and intervene on their own terms, on their own ground” </p2>
<br>
<p>How the profession is supposed to take part in mass media, how it is to be shown in the public domain and how to increase the interest and understanding of the work that graphic designers do does not have one singular answer. There are no wrongs, and there is not one solution. There are many.  In her text What has writing got to do with design? Anne Burdick wrote “Writing can feed the profession in two ways: through the challenge of critical analysis and through the exploratory freedom of self-initiated work.” Interestingly she considers the critical analysis also as a challenge for designers themselves, not just for professional writers. It is a statement that might refer to the need of more graphic designers writing graphic design criticism. The reason seems to be that it will help creating a better insight into our profession, the visuals we use, the forms in which we communicate, the theories, the facts, the history and the future. “What is particularly interesting about criticism in general is how different perspectives give rise to different meanings. This has been fully realised in film criticism, for instance; the same film can be fodder for a formal, feminist, psychoanalytic or semiotic analysis, each offering a new way to read the text. Criticism doesn’t yield answers, only opinions, and opinions should be diverse.” </p>

<p>There is this border between those who are on the outside and those who are on the inside of the profession. An invisible wall based on belonging? understanding? caring? or perhaps it has to do with what one can call the the institution of graphic design. There are many people at work to make the profession function, perhaps more than most people understand. “Writing has a profound effect on Institution Design, the elaborate apparatus that surrounds design production.” What can we bring to the discourse in the public domain that increases the interest of the broader readership, so that it will reflect back on the field and highlight what we need to evolve? “Even though critiques are perhaps something that can enhance the field to the public, I don’t think that’s the most constructive way to go about it. I think it’s more interesting to try and find it within the context of a larger society, rather than just picking out what’s good or bad about the way something is done.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is the discussion that we have internally in the field.” Suggesting here that what we, as a field, need to figure out is how to open up to the rest of the society. What we need is not an internal discussion on how criticism should be written, but a discourse of how to be more inclusive? “Good as some graphic design criticism is, even the best of it has some way to go before it can equal the most fluent, supple and engaging writing on the other arts. One basic but crucial difference is that these more public subjects attract people whose primary ambition and talent is for writing and who realize this ambition through a medium that fascinates them. Graphic design is not by and large – may never be? – such a subject. It’s a catch-22, because without such writers to bring it alive graphic design stands much less chance of becoming a discourse of wider public interest.”</p>

<h1>Part 2</h1>

<p>One solution to this ongoing problem of defining what graphic design criticism is, and what it should be, is to understand it more as an umbrella term. A term that unifies a set of ideas, approaches, seeing it more as both contextual and ephemeral ways to comment on the field. An umbrella term covers a broad number of functions or items that all fall under a single common category. “You have criticism that can happen through objects, and then the discussions that you have are also a way of having design criticism along with exhibitions. So, there’s no set way of doing it.” By acknowledging that the approaches to criticism can result in other things than written articles, we also broaden its scope and ability to reach out. It allows for more participants to contribute, because the contributor would no longer be dependent on a set of tools for critical writing. That does not necessarily mean that what it brings into the public discussion, whether within the field or in mass media, should be simplified, or dumbed down.</p>

<p>“Laermans compares the cultural sector to an onion, in which the outer peel contains incidental participants in the culture. The middle peel of the onion consists of an interested public that follows cultural life in specialised papers and magazines and attends cultural events more or less actively. The ‘connoisseurs’ can be found at the core of the onion and are perceived as a group of friends.” Contributions to the broader term of criticism can, and should, come from all three levels of the cultural sector. “It is still unusual for graphic design to be discussed anywhere other than in professional publications and a few academic journals; in addition, oversight by the media begets oversight by the public (even by academics in neighbouring disciplines), so that the vast majority of people are not accustomed to thinking of graphic design as a vital part of culture worthy of continuous (or even sporadic) comment.”</p>

<p>Because I now suggest to consider graphic design criticism as an umbrella term for all the critical activities that might take place and create more attention from outside of the field, I want to express again that I am still considering written criticism as an important aspect of this. “Graphic design is neither strictly visual nor strictly verbal. It is the marriage of the two: fused, bonded, inseparable.” To have written pieces in mass media on a regular basis will, in the long term, make people accustomed to it. Rick Poynor elaborated this by writing that “Graphic design has been overlooked precisely because it forms the connective tissue that holds so many ordinary visual experiences together. We don’t usually view a professional photograph in isolation: We view it as part of a page, screen, billboard, or shop window display in relationship with other pictorial, typographic and structural elements determined in the design process. These frameworks and relationships are an indivisible part of the meaning.”</p>

<p>A common problem among students, and perhaps also professionals, of graphic design is the frustration with theories about our field. A problem of not understanding why these discussions take form and what the goal of it is. Often misunderstanding theories as suggestions to how we need to think and work, as attempts to unify the mindset of graphic designers in general. They seem reluctant to speak their opinions on topics such as politics, history and future development, but are often quick on the trigger when it comes to disregarding other contributions to the debate. “British scholar Terry Eagleton, has argued that “hostility to theory usually means an opposition to other people´s theories and an oblivion of ones own.” (…) We all have theories!” So that there is disagreement means that we all, in fact, have theories of our own. Though they are not perhaps easy to word. “Stuart Hall noted “the only theory worth having is that which you have to fight off, not that which you speak with profound fluency.” Hinting that allowing other people to disagree, to defend the ideas, the design and the choices you have made will improve the already growing theories. “It is clear to me that we need to cultivate a healthy regard for theory – any and all theory – to evaluate it on its own terms, take what we need and remember that if graphic design is really going to mature, it needs theory not merely as a design tool, but as a way to make it truly significant and consequential in the decades to come.”</p>

<p>Max Bruinsma wrote “Culturally speaking, in spite of the growing forces of corporate convergence and globalisation, the world has become a network of properties. These properties may be called lifestyles, subculture, pressure organisations, lobby groups, themed communities, special interests, activists or what have you, but regardless of their tag, they interlink, communicate, interact and overlap.” He continued saying that “Linking these peripheries with each other and with what remains of the centres of cultural identity and power is a design commission of the greatest importance.” Graphic design as a field is part of what constitutes the centres of cultural identity. Culture is what defines us as human beings, and design is part of culture and so on. It is a way of understanding who we are. “Broadly speaking the public domain is what individuals necessarily have in common to be able to exist as individuals.” Graphic design in public space is the some of the glue that holds everything together, and therefor demands a place in mass media. It is part of what defines us as as a society. “One great potential of the mediated society, with its open access to the infrastructures of mass communication, is that if you care enough, you can make a difference right in the centre of discourse. Although you may not be in a position to fire radical change now, you could be part of the public debate and help change the perspective“ So the feeling of not being heard, the idea of not contributing because it will not reach out, is no longer valid. The way that our society functions today, with the concept of sharing everything on the cloud, on internet, we are all contributors. Hence we are all responsible. “The public domaine is seeing the same paradoxical situation as the market sector: despite all the emphasis on distinction and identity, a clear tendency can be discerned in the most diverse social areas – towards greater uniformity and standardisation of the producers and styles of designers. The diversity of visual culture is decreasing rather than increasing.” A comment that should be rather worrying for most designers, as we all strive to distinct ourselves from others, to find a style and a mark. Even more so it is a comment that should encourage us to participate; if not for the greater good, than for personal reasons. A written discussion, a vocal debate, a designed comment on society all help to enrich our visual and literal vocabulary. “In a given community, 90% of the ‘users’ are passive consumers and only 1 % of the users is responsible for the most important content” We should change this, not only on the cloud, but also in the real public domain. Stop being satisfied as passive receivers of important content, stop worrying that our contribution will not be well received, and realise that the only way to get a yes is to ask for it. I reflected on the fact that I might come across as a preacher of an ideology that can not be put to life, but I see no reason as to why I should not do that. Already in 1936 Walter Benjamin supported this way of thinking: “He was convinced that the creative work is “better, the more consumers is able to turn into producers – that is, readers or spectators into collaborators” What is disappointing is that still today, 78 years later, only 1% of us contribute with important content. Most of us seem content as consumers, and not producers. </p>


<p>There is also the separation between ideological, or social work, and the more client based work to take into consideration.“The distinction between the public and the private domaine has become less clear, as has the discussion between different types of commission: state, market, culture.” Previously this distinction has been part of what defined whether there was a need for graphic designers to contribute to the public discussions. “I think both of those sides can try to see that value in each other’s work more perhaps, but these divides have always existed and they always will, and they don’t only exist in design, they exist in the larger society as well. People have things that they consider to be more important and that they want.” Another concept of contributing that often designers apply to limit themselves in participating in the public domain is the idea of having to choose: Either you work ideological or you work  for clients. “I´m convinced you can do both: earn a good living by working for companies (…) and at the same time work with those whose critical views you can share,” Bruinsma continues: “they both have become suburbs of the global village, with a lot of traffic between them.” What we need to avoid is creating a situation where the flow of information is one-way, from the experts to the public. From what Laermanns referred to as ‘connoisseurs’ to the incidental participators. This way of communicating will not create an active debate, it will alienate those with a potential interest. Alvin Lustig wrote that “To begin with, design is related in some way to the world, the society that creates it. Whether you’re talking about architecture, furniture, clothing, homes, public buildings, utensils, equipment, each period of design is an expression of the society. People will respond most warmly and directly to those designs which express their feeling and their tastes. It takes time for people to adjust to design.” As well as it takes time for people to adjust to their part in contributing to the design field.</p>

<p>Kristina Kreole Bore moved back to Norway after her masters degree in London because she felt there was a need to start having these discussions, and that here was room for it, what lacked was a clear direction. She pointed out that: “there is also this thing in Oslo where people are quite happy to go home at 17:00.”  considering the contribution to the field of graphic design as something limited to work hours. She also pointed out that when there are events, at places such as Grafill, it is usually the same kind of people there, everyone knows each other. “This is the case in most countries, but I think especially here. I was really surprised in how little people were actually engaged in their profession, outside of ’just’ making, if you will.” There seems to be a lack of discussion outside of these events. It is work, and when you are done you go home. “Maybe these people are at home and discussing it with other people, but that’s not in public space. It’s not very generous. I think it needs to be taken more into the public, if it is happening at all, and it’s a way to take ourselves seriously. It’s a way to show others, outside of the field, that we do take ourselves seriously and that the profession is an important one.” To be able to give something to the broader readership, or the audience if you will, we need to offer something of ourselves. It is about contributing to create a common ground for interest. Get it down on the ground, to a level where it can interact and create a room for a different kinds of communications. Perhaps is writing just one out of many aspects of criticism/reflection that is needed to make it evolve. “It is no exaggeration to say that designers are engaged in nothing less than the manufacture of the contemporary reality”</p>

<h1>Part 3</h1>
<br>
<p2>If graphic design is a truly significant cultural, social, and economic force, then it has the potential to be a subject of wider academic (and public) interest, but it will need to be framed and presented in ways that relate to the concerns of viewers who are not designers — that is, to most viewers. As habitually inward-looking custodians of their own history, few graphic design educators have proven to be effective at this outward-looking, viewer-oriented style of writing and public address.[46]</p2>
<br>
<p>This part of my thesis focuses on the potential changes I can attempt to create by changing the environment in Norway. A play with solutions and suggestions that understand graphic design criticism in its broader term, as everything encompassing criticism. I do this because I believe that to create a work situations where we, the graphic designers, look outside of our own reach. Where the “viewers”, as Rick Poynor here calls them, can relate to the content. Can understand what is presented and find some interest in it. The profession should take itself serious, we should write academic articles, we should write our own history, we should create content for this history, but to do all of this we need to make it approachable. I bring in the oxford dictionary again: to be approachable means to be friendly and easy to talk to. Synonyms used to describe this term are friendly, welcoming, pleasant, agreeable, congenial, affable, cordial, well disposed, obliging, communicative, open, hospitable, helpful; informal, easy-going, accessible, available, easy to get on/along with. These are wonderful terms to use to describe our profession, and I want this to be a fact. How can do this? With these synonyms in mind I set out to think of events, situations, articles and inspirations I could use to create an environment where graphic design criticism would be able to evolve into a subject considered one that is of concern to viewers who are not designers. Playfulness was the first idea that came to mind.

<h2>3.1 The communication game.</h2>
<br>
<p>The idea for the communication game was inspired by a lecture on an art/dance project called the transportation dance and his use of´ ‘transporting cards.’ The performance, the artwork and the groundwork for this project was about crossing borders, it is a risk sport (TRANSLATE), creating connections, making an event. Most of all it was about looking at children, and how letting go can make old and young people alike enjoy the same things. Unpredictability is also omega, it is about creating a sensation, and taking part in something that feels important. A notion that immediately makes me think that it would be newsworthy, and interesting for the daily press and the broader readership. Most of us can relate to the intuitional, to the daring. But how to be unpredictable? Like the transportation dance have a deck of cards, suggesting a set of movements that one could do at work, on the road, when sitting, when cooking and so on. This could be a set of cards, like conversation cards, but with acting. Action cards for the active designer. Cards for development. What can we really do?</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3.2 Guerrilla Pecha Kucha</h2>
<br>
<p>Pecha kucha is an international concept that has been well received and developed in most countries. It is also a concept that has been able to become a strong foundation in Norway, taking place in most of the bigger cities. In Oslo it is hosted by DogA, the centre for Design and Architecture, where it is filmed, documented and archived on the websites of one of Norways biggest newspapers, Aftenposten. Interestingly the talks from Pecha kuchas are collected and archived much the same way I would imagine that graphic design articles, film snippets and other documentation should be. It is interesting for people of all backgrounds, educational, sometimes informative and other times for fun. It is a source for knowledge for sharing and for developing the community.  I looked through all the Pecha kuchas that were available online and found one related to graphic design, talking about how designers should organise their lives to function better as people, but also as designers. An interesting talk in itself. But that fact that this was the only one made me consider the possibility of curating a Pecha kucha. Inviting a set of speakers to talk about different aspects of graphic design, covering a range of the profession. From exhibitions, to history, teaching, workshops, writing, social responsibility and more marketing related topics. Reaching out to those who are interested to show the variation of people involved, the variation of projects, of interests.
<br>
A part of this project would be to document the presentations, film it, and get the talks available on the online newspaper as well. In this way infiltrating the already existing archive, as well as gathering the talks and presentations to make a publication that would be distributed during future Pecha kucha.
<br>
What comes out of it?</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3.3 One night only</h2>
<br>
<p>Compared to other similar disciplines, like product design, architecture or photography, there are relatively few exhibitions about graphic design. Anna Craemer wrote on her website that “the purpose of museums and galleries is to conserve, educate or entertain.” It is not only educating the general public, it is about educating graphic designers. “Posters, collected and saved have always been one of the most prominent and important media in graphic design and it’s history” It is a way of sharing present and past history.  “I learned by looking at pictures.” Paul Rand said, but looking at reproductions never gives the same experiences as viewing the real work. </p>

<p>Today graphic design can be found in museums and galleries. “The objects do not have the same material value, are not as collectable and do not have the same display potential as three-dimensional forms of design. Of course, books, posters and album covers are collected, displayed in the home and treasured for their nostalgic qualities, but in the museums they are not big crowd-pullers compared to the other applied arts.” There a few important galleries, museums and institutions collecting and presenting graphic design. We have The Museum of the Image in Breda (NL), the Kemistry Gallery in London (UK), Walker Art Centre in Minneapolis (USA), The Poster Museum at Wilanów (PL), as well as in festivals and biennials such as the Chaumont International Poster and Graphic Design Festival, the International Biennial of Graphic Design Brno and the Graphic Design Festival Scotland to mention a few. The goals of these galleries, museums, biennials and festivals are to provide opportunities for people to learn, develop skills and grow as well as empowering graphic and visual designers. It is about bringing Graphic Design into the public domain, perhaps in a different context than how we normally approach the public space. These events are about creating connections, increase communication and setting industry standards. It is about creating links between the inside and outside of graphic design as well as links within.</p>

<p>Craemer continued by asking: “So why are there not more graphic design exhibitions? Like every product or service, it's success depends on 'supply and demand'. It would be easy, to blame the ignorant public for the little demand for graphic design exhibitions – of not seeing the importance of more access to graphic design education.” Her conclusion was that the general public is not the target group. Graphic designers are. Once again touching on the comments of Kristina Kreole Bore “It can’t just be in the one place, it needs to be triggered and fuelled by something and so, when there are so little critical activities happening in the field itself, it doesn’t lend itself easily to write about it.” There needs to be a system of supply and demand for museums and galleries to exhibit graphic design, and there is by no means a lack of it to exhibit. The final question, Craemer wrote, is why are not more graphic designer interested in learning more about graphic design? To keep the Kemistry Gallery alive, not only money is needed, but a bigger craving for graphic design education.</p>

<p>What do I suggest to do about this? How to increase interest for education, for exhibiting graphic design? The answer is make is short and sweet. I suggest that the graphic design profession in Norway should learn from the concept One Night Only Gallery (ONO). It is a artist run gallery space that was established in 2008. Every monday for six years they have opened a new exhibition. The works are collected in a website that functions as an archive. “We discovered how valuable the website is, with all the documentation of younger artists that normally you don't find access to see their works.” It is possible to look at the programmes, at the artists that have exhibited and their work. There is added text and press releases. The archive is supposed to be a resource for artists, press and people outside of the field. By creating a digital resource of artists, both old and new, it becomes more approachable for those outside of the art circle. It is a concept of sharing knowledge about a profession that often finds itself at a distance from the general public, much like graphic design. Important to mention is that their website comes across as more than a portfolio collection. It is because it is a project of interest in both what is going on outside of the art field as much as it is about those who work within. It is a concept that is easy to copy and recently they developed two new branches one in Switzerland and one in Vilnius Together with the other international branches they swap exhibitions, even though they have a low budget. They said in a presentation that “it was hard to start, we had to force people to exhibit, now we have to decline.” Meaning that once the concept was developed and the groundwork was built, both artists and audience acknowledge the value of such a exhibition space and initiative. At this present time they are presenting their weekly One Night Only exhibitions at Kunsternes Hus, an artist run institution with a focus on contemporary art. It hosts a cafe, bar, torpedo bookstore and exhibition spaces as well as events.</p>

<p>A graphic design One Night Only in Oslo could be hosted by Grafill, the organisation for visual communication, as they already have a gallery space. Perhaps it could be developed as a branch of the original One Night Only concept? </p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3.4 A percentage of time</h2>
<br>
<p2>“Imagine that every design studio donated a small percentage of its time and resources to “the public cause” however they perceive it – this single act would help take back some of the public domain that is so dominated by advertising in its blandest form. (…) Design can be a potent tool to channel these peripheries back to the centre of the civil discourse of democracy , the agora, the marketplace of ideas and opinions which is the public domain. That, ultimately, is what responsible designers, as cultural agents, should aim at: Keeping the eyes and minds of their fellow citizens wide open.”</p2>
<br>
<p>Imagine that every designer did what Max Bruinsma here suggests, contribute a percentage to time and resources to the “public cause” however they see it. The idea alone make me exited. What do we care about? How do we translate that? What medium would we use? Who would we talk to? What will it look like?</p>

<p>With a percentage of time I want to create an environment where designers bring what they themselves find important to the table, in various formats, a collection of contributions. The collected results would perhaps be archived in a website, presented as a one night only, or shared in a different manner. One single act, that might become a part of a bigger picture. To get the ball rolling I would contact Grafill and ask them to send it to their members, contact Westerdals, KHiO and other art schools and ask them to send it to their students, contact graphic design studios in Norway, publishers, journalists and critics. What can they contribute? More interestingly will I receive anything? Either way the result will be visual and able to tell me something about the intentions of the profession in Norway. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Cocnlusion</h1>
<br>
<p>“By definition design entails a movement from known to unknown, from what exists to what does not yet exist, from actual to the possible and then back to the actual.” To be able to take a step and develop graphic design criticism in Norway further we need to create new platforms for debate, for presentation, for participation. “To build an effective design criticism, we will have to create our own perspectives, fashioned out of a number of other techniques.” By understanding that criticism can take on a number of forms, and using this to our advantage. By playing with potential approaches. By allowing for disagreement. By creating more diversity. We open the doors for more participation. And in the end I realise that this is what I have been asking for this whole time. Lowering the bars for what is approved of as contribution might be the solution to increase the “value” of the debate. “Perhaps now, as greater fluency develops in the broad population for visual symbol-making and -manipulation, an era in which a significant fluency for grasping the bases of meaning production in graphic design will emerge.” If the line of communication goes both ways, the fluency of the broad population will increase. We adjust ourselves to our surroundings. Just like we adjusted ourselves to read texts set in sans serif, like we adjusted to sensation based mass media, like we adjust to consumer societies, we can adjust to a contribution based society. “And now? A whole new world of possibilities, in the simplest creative sense, but also a change of heart and a change of technological possibility.” The fact that contribution is a mouse click away should be enough to end this discussion. </p>
