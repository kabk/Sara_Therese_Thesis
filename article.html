<h2>Chapter 1<br>
Introduction</h2>

<p>Encouraged by the belief that writing can be an important tool for understanding the graphic design discipline,&nbsp;I will in this thesis attempt to understand why there is almost no public debate on the subject in Norway. Active participation in criticism,&nbsp;not only from the inside but also from the outside of the profession, can lead to significant development in the field. Anna Craemer wrote on her website about graphic design philosophy «The newspapers are full of criticism on art, literature, music, cinema, theatre, fashion, architecture, food and, sometimes, even product design. But there is very little writing on graphic design in the public press.» This is a question I have been asking myself; Is it because there is no interest for it among the readers, does it have to do with the general opinion of what graphic design is? And lastly if there is a need for a debate on graphic design in public media?<br><br>

After a symposium on the topic of design criticism at KHiO in Oslo it became apparent to me that there is a lack of coverage on the graphic design discipline in Norwegian media today. The symposium asked questions I have not thought of in relation to Norway and the graphic design scene, but I left with more questions than answers. What determines the lack of coverage on graphic design in media? The bigger reason that there is no graphic design criticism, or philosophy, in public media in Norway today could be a result of; the designers themselves, the projects they work on, the role of advertisement in media, the editors, the journalists, the lack of readers interests, etc., the list is long. Perhaps the answer is to be found in the political system. The use of public space, the regulations of public domain? Or lastly, a rather troubling factor to consider, it might just be that this topic is by and for graphic designers only. Steven Heller wrote: “Maybe graphic design is just so ephemeral that serious criticism has no place. Maybe graphic design simply doesn’t warrant public interest. After all, not all fields and professions are so examined.” These are all thoughts and questions I will look into, try to understand and argue for or against. I believe there is need for examination of the profession, also on a national level.<br><br>

To attempt to define what affects the situation, this thesis is based on research from&nbsp;international&nbsp;graphic design history, theory and criticism, which is used to create a background for understanding the situation in Norwegian media. Interviews with Norwegian graphic design historians, journalists, architect critics, graphic design organisations will be used to set the international references into the context of graphic design criticism in Norway.&nbsp;Looking at the situation through different angles, attempting to narrow down what the causes are, or can be, and maybe help find a suggestion on how to solve this situation. <br><br>

“Compared to art or film criticism, the term ‘graphic design criticism’ has an unfamiliar, slightly uncomfortable ring to it. It is one that even the most avid reader of graphic design magazines and books will encounter rarely, if at all”. This was how Rick Poynor described criticism of the graphic design profession. Graphic design criticism have been debated since the beginning of the 80’s. The first call for graphic design criticism came already in 1983, in a paper called Keynote Adress by Massimo Vignelli. He commented on the lack of engagement with and the study about the meaning of graphic design. Vignelli focused on the importance of criticism to show designers which direction to go in, because the time had come for designers to stop commenting only on the visual appearance of each others work, to start investigating why and how projects were made and what motivated it. «Without criticism we will never have a profession» he wrote, a statement that might be as valid today as it was back then. What he was calling for was the creation of a cultural structure for the graphic design profession, a structure that would be based on criticism, documentation, theory and technology.<br><br>

In the years that have passed since then graphic design criticism have been much debated, and quite often called for in articles written by both designers, historians and journalists. What happened to the criticism that was asked for? Where did it go? If anything, it did not turn to the popular media. To be able to call for professional graphic design criticism, or even an amateur one, we need to define who it should be made for, why it should be written, and what media or platform to use to communicate with. Pierre Bernard wrote that “there is no single notion of or approach to what design is or should be: on the contrary, there is a whole panorama of notions and approaches” a comment that might well be used to enlighten the situation of graphic design criticism. It is a broad topic with many versions and variations of both in content and form. Criticism can be seen as the everyday reviews published in daily papers, telling people what they should or should not buy. Semi long articles about an art-piece, architectural project or about the design of a newly published book written by both journalists, designers, architects and historians.  Or the deeper research based critical works, often taking the shape of books. The latter being academic, a piece of research, a collection or a history such as the book Graphic History In The Writing by Sara de Bondt. A collection of graphic design history and criticism mostly read by graphic designers themselves.<br><br>

What is the difference between theoretical and academic criticism and the personal opinion (often found in daily papers) and how to absolve the differences to create a climate where there is room for both in daily papers? Hudson wrote that freedom lies in the multiplication of opportunities for making real choices – in judgement, in belief, in purpose, in action. And continued saying that the liberally educated person has a wider choice of things to think about. If freedom is in the opportunity to make real choices, to judge, then the opinionated debate, in this case about graphic design, should be available to all of the public. The question moves away from whether we need it or not, to a question of who should curate graphic design criticism, or if it even needs a curator? Should this be on the shoulders of designers themselves, should there be a forum for design critique and design thinking such as the recently started designkritikk.no? Or should we have an actual museum of design criticism led by a curator, a person who runs the discussion, sees the overview and is able to regulate. Perhaps the better option would be to have no curation at all, maybe the best approach would be to gather, and share. A collective brain is better than an independent one. So instead of a curator, what we need is a collector, and archiver that structures the debate that takes place and makes it visible. The question that becomes important then would be who creates the criteria of graphic design criticism? Journalists, designers, academics?</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Chapter 2<br>
Graphic Design Criticism in the media</h2>
<br><br>
<p>In Norwegian media today there seems to be no existing structure for how, and in what platforms, graphic design criticism should be written. Often when there is a piece written on design in public media it is about product design. The writer taking on the role as a reviewer, discussing which products the readers should and should not buy. The review should be considered as a form of criticism, one that can also be used about graphic design, though mostly about books, as these are easier to judge as products of value to the user. The review is, as a text, neither useless, nor a negative thing in itself, but this alone does not suffice to create a public awareness of the role of graphic design, if that is even what we want?
<br><br>

Discussions on graphic design seldom takes place in the Norwegian media, though recently there has been two exceptions, or examples if you will, that stands out. First to mention was the competition for the redesign of the Norwegian money, that attracted both national and international opinion. Both on a level of good vs. bad and a broader discussion on the aims and uses of the new designs. The second I want to mention was also a competition, redesigning the Norwegian passports. This time it did not receive the same level of  international attention as the newly designed money, and therefor the discussion or mention of it died out in Norwegian media much faster. I will come back to these two examples throughout the text, but they are an interesting introduction to use to show what criticism in Norway today might be considered as.
<br><br>
The mere fact that both these cases were mentioned in mainstream media gives these projects a point in time, suggests that these designs are of importance to society (as they rightfully are: the new money and passports), and by doing so writes them into the Norwegian history of graphic design. It does so because what will be remembered in the future are the designs that were discussed, reproduced and printed in the presence. Robin Kinross asked:“What then might design history be?”, is it only a collection of what we discuss and remember from media and books today, if so it saddens me to say that the Norwegian history of graphic design will be limited. Much of what was important today would then be forgotten. Kinross continued saying “I am inclined to suggest that the term be discarded in favor of ‘design criticism’ (‘design theory’ sounds too forbiddingly remote in our pragmatic context). The point is that history happens anyway, as soon as one starts to ground something in its time and place.“ So in order to create a stronger graphic design history in Norway, we need to develop graphic design criticism. The reason is that graphic design criticism is what ‘pins’ the current situation, debate, discussion and development to the ‘ground’. What we put on the agenda today, might be what validates information on graphic design in Norway as useful in the future. </p>
<br><br>

<h2>Chapter 3<br>
What then is criticism? </h2>
<br><br>
<p>“It is interesting how one says `good work’. You have this awkward business of what the criteria of judgment are.“ Not only is it difficult to decide what good and bad graphic design is because, as mentioned here, we do not have a universal set of criteria to judge by. It is also difficult to determine what the term criticism means. In the English language there seems to be a better understanding of it, than in the Norwegian where the word kritikk has a bad connotation, often referring to pointing out the negative. As Martin Braaten, editor of Arkitektnytt, pointed out in an interview with me “they (ed. the english language) have the posh version, critique, with q, u, e.” The oxford dictionary describe critique as: A detailed analysis and assessment of something, especially a literary, philosophical, or political theory.  The definition here referring to texts and understandings which are clearly academic, perhaps not for mainstream media, but what it does not mention is being critical in the negative sense. Criticism in general was describes as: The analysis and judgement of the merits and faults of a literary or artistic work. Interesting with this definition is that it also mentions merits, meaning what is good, what is worthy, what should be mentioned. Adapting these definitions to graphic design criticism would mean to look at the project or work, the context and the usage and analysing what was good and worth mentioning, what needs to be drawn into attention, and what should be improved. Graphic design critique then would be a more academic analysis, more in depth research about a project, or a situation, and creating a theory as to why it is what it is and what implications or benefits that might have.
<br><br>
Looking at the definition of the terms critique and criticism is one thing, understanding what most people read into these two terms is another. “Criticism,” one internationally renowned designer declared, “usually takes the form of the negative and the overly judgmental.”? More often than not criticism is considered to have a negative connotation. Not so much in the world of art, literature, architecture, music and theatre criticism, but within design. To be critical is often connected with being judgemental. “To be judgmental is to wag a finger and raise the voice, to carp and repress. Called to account in such morally loaded terms, criticism can’t possibly be a good thing. But this is, in reality, a considerable misrepresentation of the critical process when responsibly carried out.“ The oxford dictionary also wrote that criticism could mean the scholarly investigation of literary or historical texts to determine their origin or intended form. In the case of graphic design criticism it can be transferred to looking at the project / product to analyse what was the origin, what was the approach taken, what was the intention, how was it received and what is there to learn from it?
<br><br>
“It is hardly the purpose of criticism to squash its subjects arbitrarily. On the other hand, being a critic does require the exercise of judgment based on all the writer’s knowledge and experience. The writer who wilfully suspends judgment, or fears to make it, lets down the reader and ultimately perhaps the subject itself. This critical process will often lead to conclusions at odds with those of the subject. But while the process might be intrinsically adversarial, it is not inherently negative even if the ordinary usage of the verb – to criticize – makes it sound as though it is. Criticism’s conclusions may be largely or even wholly supportive of the subject.”
<br><br>
What Rick Poynor and Michael Rock here tries to narrow down is the terminology problem, criticisms close connection to the verb criticise, often misunderstood as the meaning of criticism. Allan Lustig said “I don’t think it’s a question of good design or bad design!“ It is not about pointing fingers, it is not about scanning projects for flaws and mistakes, though sometimes they should be mentioned. Well written criticism can be made with the intention of calling for attention to good projects that have not been seen, to encourage, to inspire, but yes, also to criticise. The latter is important as a constructive element in the development of new directions and ways of thinking within the profession. Anne Burdick wrote “Through discussion and review we are held accountable to our peers, and as a result words of praise carry greater weight. Constructive criticism should not be something we fear; it should be something we welcome.”
<br><br>

</p><h2>Chapter 4<br>
Style of writing most often used,
and why it is difficult to print serious criticism daily media</h2>
<br><br>
<p>“Ever since its inception graphic design has been above criticism. Not because it is inherently uncriticizable, but because designers have neither a critical vocabulary, nor the means to address work in a public forum.The majority of trade magazines showcase rather than analyze individual design. And while informal crits (teacher to student and client to designer) are routinely carried out in the privacy of a classroom or office, substantive criticism is rarely presented before a larger audience, no less a broader public. ”
<br><br>

Pieces written on design are often written by journalists with a lack of experience in the field, and seldom these writers get to write more than a few articles on the same topic. This creates a situation where there is a lack of ‘educated’ writers. Not to say what we need is an education in the definition of the word, but we need writers with an interest, with an experience, who is able to translate graphic design projects into an understandable topic for readers of the daily paper. Often when graphic design is mentioned in a Norwegian newspaper it is presented as an image slideshow instead of as an article. One example would be the yearly competition hosted by Grafill on the best book design. Several years in a row the winners were published online on dagbladet.no as an image gallery with one caption to fit all of the images. This becomes a visual reproduction solely about the aesthetic of the books in the competition. Is it wrong? no, I would not call it wrong. Could it be more? Certainly. This competition would be an opportunity for Norwegian media to take interest in the designers, in the profession, in the market, in the process and in the public reactions. By looking deeper into a competition such as the best book design of the year there would be availability for interviews, for studio visits, for articles, for debate on content and visualization and  for questioning the production. Is it not interesting that most norwegian books get their paper, their printing, their typefaces, their binding and so on abroad? Perhaps this is knowledge the daily papers do not have.
<br><br>
One reason why the articles on a competition such as this ends up as an image series might be found in this quote from The Small Crit by Steven Heller:  “Even mainstream journalists with a penchant for graphic design complain that aside from the incidental story about momentary fashionable graphic conceits, it is truly difficult to pitch and get accepted a serious article on graphic design as a cultural force, no less get a critical perspective into print.” Why should it be difficult to get an article on graphic design criticism published? During the symposium at KHiO there was a discussion that raised the same question. Several journalists in the audience claimed that even though they were interested in writing more about design, even graphic design, their editors were not interested in publishing. This suggests that what Steven Heller brings to attention might also be the case in Norwegian papers. Why editors question this content can have many reasons, and most likely the answer is to be found in a combination of them.
<br><br>
Firstly there is the situation where most printed magazines and daily papers in Norway today are being dependent on advertisement as an important income. It is a situation where the advertisers, perhaps silently, perhaps not directly, partly control what the content in the printed matter might be. In the same symposium a previous editor of the Scandinavian design magazine Form mentioned that they had over a longer period of time chosen not to publish to critical articles. As a way to show respect to the design field, to the writers and to themselves as a design magazine they collected these articles in one number of the magazine dedicated to critical writing. As a result of this critical edition of Form most of their big sponsors choose to withdraw. Hence a situation where one can be led to believe that advertising and sponsoring is part of what defines the lack of graphic design criticism in daily papers and media today.
<br><br>
Secondly there seems to be a lack of faith in the readers interest and/or capabilities of understanding this topic among the editors of daily papers. “Although recently the graphic design profession has had its share of coverage in the mass media, usually in the form of trendsetter profiles – i.e. Carson, Barron, Kalman, and Brody – ghettoized in the ‘style’ sections of newspapers and magazines, but never have individual works been singled out for critique in the press in the same manner as a current exhibition, film, or for that matter, advertising campaigns.“ Graphic design mentioned in newspapers seem to be sensation based, not considering so much the content of a project, rather showing of the successful creators.
<br><br>

Thirdly freelance articles on design criticism in general are periodical and not well categorised and organised, they are hard to keep track of and to be updated on. To be able to have a continuous debate there needs to be contributors to the debate. “Occasional paper writing in the course of research is not the same as being a fully fledged critic, writing regularly about a broad range of graphic design subjects, or many different aspects of the same subject.” One of the reasons the writings on graphic design is so fragmented is because the contributors most of the time are writing as a side-project. Devoting most of their time to other aspects of professional life, be that design, writing or something completely different. It is a situation where the people that write the criticism comes from many different backgrounds, sometimes it could even be a sports journalist. The latter not being a wrong candidate for writing in a public debate, the problem being that because most of the printed debate is freelance and arrives periodically. That there is no (fast) column, or space for it in public media, the writers also do not get to develop their personal language for writing. The vocabulary for sparking an interest, or a discussion, is limited. “Whatever the discipline, the critic is engaged in a process of interior and exterior discovery, a riskily public dialogue with the subject matter, the readership, and him or herself. Critical positions will inevitably evolve over time, Errors of judgment will sometimes be made. The critic can only learn what is possible by constantly writing. “ Writing as everything else demands experience to develop. Serious film critics would be a good example for how graphic design criticism can develop. Written texts on film that are often followed by readers, both from within and outside of the profession, with different levels of interest, yet the text is interesting for them all. Another problem that occurs due to the fragmented situation of design criticism in general, graphic design criticism more specifically, is that important articles of interest for discussions are seldom followed up by interviews or replies. This leads to a situation where those of the readers who are interested in following up this content would have to do the gathering or collecting of a debate themselves, if it is followed in the media at all.
<br><br>
Lastly “In the media the prevailing view is that design is a market- related phenomenon, if not a marketing tool”  If graphic design is conicered as a part of the market, at the market sphere, then the cultural attention and the value it might have in the public space is diminished. This will lead to a lack of interest in what is going on within the profession. </p>
<br><br><br>

<h2>Chapter 5<br>
Why graphic design criticism is important for the profession?</h2>
<br><br>
<p>In her text What has writing got to do with design? Anne Burdick wrote “Writing can feed the profession in two ways: through the challenge of critical analysis and through the exploratory freedom of self-initiated work.” Interestingly she considers the critical analysis as a challenge for designers themselves as well, not only for professional writers. It is a statement that might refer to the need of more graphic designers writing graphic design criticism. The reason seems to be that it will help creating a better insight into our profession, the visuals we use, the forms in which we communicate, the theories, the facts, the history and the future. </p>
