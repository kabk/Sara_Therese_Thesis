<h2>Interview<br>
Kristina Kreole Bore</h2>
<br>
<p3>First can you tell me about your work description, and how this maybe relates to design criticism in Norway. Just a quick, first introduction.</p>
<br>
<p>Well, as I mentioned via email, my MA is in something called design writing criticism, which is a course that was made up of one part that was quite academic and historical, while the other part was more trade-related- meaning that is had journalistic intention, if you will. So, that was what I worked with on my MA; design criticism and what that can mean, and that is also what I continue to work with in my practice today. So, I teach a bit, I just came back from Estonia where I taught a week of workshop for the graphic design students- talking about writing and reflecting, and about how those two are intrinsically related to each other. Apart from actually writing about design, I am also going to go into the structures of the design field. And then, I’m part of a small publishing house and we work with these kinds of questions as well, and I work freelance as a writer, and teach history and theory at the academy here. For me, it’s about all of the different things that design writing can be, because I don’t believe it is only about producing a piece of text, it can be so many other things.<p>
<br>
<p3>What kind of media in Norway do you write for?</p>
<br>
<p>Mainly, I write for trade publications. And I write for D2, and I just wrote a piece for Aftenposten K, and just something for a publication called kunstlefte (?), which is sponsored by kulturådet. And what’s kind of interesting is the things where I am most critical are not the pieces that are published in Norway, it’s for international media. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of room to do actual crituques of design in Norway, and there are several reasons for that I think. One thing is that to have that kind of critique in the media, it also needs to exist in the field, I believe. It can’t just be in the one place, it needs to be triggered and fuelled by something and so, when there are so little critical activities happening in the field itself, it doesn’t lend itself easily to write about it.</p3>
<br>
<p>I had an intention of asking you about this, because as far as I understand in Norway, the word criticism or ’krittik’ has kind of a bad conotation, it’s something  that people don’t want to find themselves doing as it feels as if you’re stepping on the toes of your co-workers. And it’s a very small community.</p3>
<br>
<p3>Do you have any ideas or thoughts about this?</p>
<br>
<p>Yeah definitely, that word has really negative connotations in Norwegian. In some ways, it does in English as well, but I believe it’s been taken in a much more constructive way in the English language. In Norwegian, we tend to think of it as something that’s just negative, while critique is something that I believe actually has a positive viewpoint, or intention because it is about saying that there is something good about something, or that has the potential to be better because it is, in fact, substantial in some way. And in the more academic world, it’s just a given that having a critical mindframe is something that you need to have to produce something good. But when I was working on my MA, I chose not to use the word ’critique’ because of what you say, because people think it’s negative in Norwegian. It doesn’t have the same culture or legacy that it does in English. So, I chose to focus on reflection instead, which I think is the starting point for any critique. But also, design critique is for me not only about these, kind of, ’reviews’ of something. Design critique can also happen in a written piece that is about looking at a specific tendency or development. Critique is about contextualisation and understanding something from a historical perspective as well as in a contemporary one. So, it’s about seeing something existing outside of the ’objects’ frame, but as part of the society, if you see what I mean.<p>
<br>
<p3>So I can assume by the way you’re talking about critique that you’re maybe a little bit against the traditional way of looking at designers; the ’hero’ designers, or the ’unique’ designers?</p>
<br>
<p>Well, I think it’s definitely one part of the design field, looking at Jonathan Ives, or Dieter Rams and all these big people that do exist, in the way that we tell the story of design. So, for journalists it can be an easy way to sell their stories- to focus on the people behind, because I think we are always curious about how someone works. We are all a bit voyeuristic, so that is an easy way to tell a story. It is a problem in design writing, because the focus has shifted from the object to the person who produced it, who is usually part of a team. So, it is a very black and white way of telling a story which goes against what I just said about the critique being about seeing something in a more nuanced way.<p>
<br>
<p>I find that difficult sometimes, when I’m just trying to understand what criticism of design can be. I want more of it, and I find that I’m calling for a discussion. But I find it difficult to understand with whom am I discussing, and what am I actually looking at. Especially in cases today, where you have design being made by so many people with such different backgrounds. I narrow it down to graphic deisgn criticism in my thesis but the fact is that you can’t always say graphic design criticism. And maybe here in Norway it’s even more difficult.</p>
<br>
<p3>You said earlier that ’it’s not a review’, and I kind of locked on that one because just recently I read Rick Poyner’s text ’it’s time for being against’, where he clearly states that the serious film journalistic model would be a good example to introduce design criticism to people.</p>
<br>
<p>Yeah, I think that as part of the design field, we tend to think that what we do is the most interesting thing in the world! And I think for anyone who’s in a creative field or who works something they’re very passionate about I thnk that’s the case and, I think it should be. But I think we also have to acknowldge that not everyone is going to be as enthusiastic as we are about a certain typrface, or the way that a layout is done, or whatever. I think it is also the way a review is written, a review and critique are not necessarily the same thing. I know that in music journalism, for example, the reviewer has been scrutinised because the question is what it actually brings to the discourse. For example, here in Norway NO is a magazine that’s trying to talk about music in a more substantial way than a simple review can do.  So, even though critiques are perhaps something that can enhance the field to the public, I don’t think that’s the most constructive way to go about it. I think it’s more interesting to try and find it within the context of a larger society, rather than just picking out what’s good or bad about the way something is done. Perhaps that is the discussion that we have internally in the field.<p>
<br>
<p3>But you think there could be some kind of writing about the field of design that actually compares it with the rest of the society, putting it into something other people understand, and maybe saying something about why it’s important or what changes it makes?</p>
<br>
<p>Yes, but then again, I don’t know if you read a recent piece on design observer about design jounalsim and the way that it’s about ’3D printing’, and these other big headings that we see across the internet especially. It’s a very easy way to write about design because you can use these crazy events, like ’3D printing the moon!’ Or these ’bio-technologies that make your sneakers heal overnight!’. This kind of design jounalism is becoming more and more used, and it’s a very easy way of communicating what something is but it doesn’t necessarily say that much about the field, or how it’s developing, apart from this crazy invention that someone’s done in the name of design. So I think that for design to exist for a larger public, it probably needs to have a bit more of something to relate to than, for example, a print magazine piece about a new typeface.</p3>
<br>
<p3>It makes a good point. How may of the readers would find it very interesting that there is a new typeface? If there was to be a platform then, I’m sitting here thinking about my assignment writing this and noticing that there is no one approach, I don’t have a linear understanding, many of the approaches might even be wrong, and lastly I don’t even know if I will have a conclusion. Probably not. But I liked the idea of having these conversations with all of these people about where this platform would be. Do you imagine it to be media, or is it online, or is it in maybe Grafill, the discussions they do/ post? I mean, how do you imagine this?<p3>
<br>
<p>I think it needs to exist both internally and externally, and I think it needs to exist within the context of other culture. Which is the way that design exists in the world as well. To isolate it for just one side that’s just about design criticism, whatever that is, I don’t think is going to be very constructive or beneficial because it’s going to be too introverted.</p3>
<br>
<p3>That would be kind of like the graphic design writing for graphic designer’s books, as much as I love them.<p3>
<br>
<p>Yes, they serve a certain purpose, but not the one that design criticism should serve. They are two different things, I think.</p3>
<br>
<p3>The recent book by Sara de Bont (?), ’graphic design in writing’, I feel it serves more as an introduction to graphic deign than as a history that we have in writing. Or as an encouragement to write.</p>
<br>
<p>Yeah, but I think that is what it is supposed to do as well. Graphic design is a really young profession, and we’ve started to write our history properly kinds of the last 20-30 years. So, it’s bound to have a lot of potential for improvement. You also see these kinds of books by Adrian Shaughnessy and Tony Brooks and these limited edition publications are really easy to market and they reach young design students who are really just hungry to see all of these crazy styles that were done. And I think it’s important because it’s a part of telling history, but I don’t think it drives our profession forward in any way, it more documents what has been there, which I guess you could say is also part of progress.</p3>
<br>
<p3>Maybe in the future it’s nice to have the past? </p>
<br>
<p>Yeah definitely, and that’s what ?????????! is also doing as well, but I think when these historical reinventions, or looking back to the past is done, it’s usually because there’s a need for it in the present, or we see that it identifies with something that is going on now. That there is a certain interest in the same kinds of questions that were asked at one point and so on. But, for me if we’re going to talk about design criticism, I think that it belongs in a bigger media than the trades, and that it needs to sit in the context of other cultural criticisms.<p>
<br>
<p3>So, it shouldn’t be boxed? That’s why I chose to say graphic design criticism, because you find art criticism, architecture criticism, music/ literature review, product design criticism, and then it all becomes very niche when you start sorting them like that. The same way as the role of the designer, maybe if you start sorting us into separate boxes.</p>
<br>
<p>It’s a really hard topic to try and solve, because it also becomes a question of what the format for it should be. Right now I’m speaking of graphic design criticism as a written form that tries to contextualise and so on, but then you have criticism that can happen through objects, and then the discussions that you have are also a way of having design criticism along with exhibitions. So, there’s no set way of doing it. The way that I’m trying to do it as a practitioner, when I’m writing in a jounalistic way, is trying to put it into a larger context of culture. For example, we did an exhibition at Grafill, almost a year ago, and that was an exhibition where we tried to reflect on graphic design history and graphic design presence, and I also see that as being ’criticism’.</p3>
<br>
<p3>Maybe especially here in Norway, where the presence of graphic design history is quite none-existent. One of the reasons I find it so interesting to focus on Norway right now with this assignment is because I can see that there has been a very big change just in the last four years, since I left, and people are kind of speeding ahead towards something within design, but at the same time, discussions here seem fruitless compared to what I’m used to.</p>
<br>
<p>I came back because I felt there was a need to start having these discussions here, and that there was room for it. But there is no clear direction, and there is also this thing in Oslo where people are quite happy to go home at 17:00. And when things are going on at Grafill, it’s usually the same kind of people there and usually everyone knows each other. This is the case in most countries, but I think espcially here. I was really surprised in how little people were actually engaged in their projession, outside of ’just’ making, if you will. There was no, or, a lack of discussion outside of that. It’s work, and then you’re done, you go home. Maybe these people are at home and discussing it with other people, but that’s not in public space. It’s not very generous. I think it needs to be taken more into the public, if it is happening at all, and it’s a way to take ourselves seriously. It’s a way to show others, outside of the field, that we do take ourselves seriously and that the profession is an important one.</p3>
<br>
<p3>I’ve been a bit scared meantioning ’value’, because you can have value in graphic design as value of the individual, made object. Does it have value even though it has a short lifespan? Or does it have less value if it’s close to advertising? Or, what is the value of the graphic designer considering that you might be the medium for someone elses message? I mean, most times you do work with other peoples content, with other peoples words, and alongside other peoples direction line. So, defining what value means in these situations I also find very tricky.</p>
<br>
<p>Yes, and I think it will have different value for different designers. But, looking at it in general, I would say that graphic design is very valuable because it has a very quick reaction to development. Graphic design can be produced really quickly, both from the designer and the printer, or if it goes on web. So, in the design field, I find it’s the discipline that has the quickest reaction span, if you can call it that. And that has a lot of value because it can tell us stuff about our society that architecture would perhaps use ten years to do. So, I think that most designers will put themselves into the work that they do even if it’s not in the content it’s still in the form-giving, which is also part of the message that is being communicated.</p3>
<b3>
<p3>I’ve been watching ’freedom on the fence’, about Polish poster traditions, and then I read this book called ’my work is not my work’ by Pierre Bernard, and both of them deal with posters in public space, although I believe you can adapt those to most graphic design. What you’re saying on the bottom line is that graphic design is almost more valued in the situations where we have kind of bigger problems to deal with; political problems- getting designers to redesign the money. Like here now and in the Netherlands in the 70’s to re-adapt the values and encourage new looks upon the government. Or if it’s because we are in a political uproar, and we need to establish new morale values, or like the Polish during censorship, as a way to establish morale among the people and envelop new hope. In all these situations, the posters have been ackowledged as quite valuable and very important. But in situations where we don’t have these kinds of roles as the ’value-maker’, the value of the poster and the value of the work also kind of diminishes. So, a question, if you really want to put it on a knife edge is, do you need big world problems to make important work?</p>
<br>
<p>No, I don’t think so, but I think that a text that is often used in design education, a text I used last week with the students in Tallin, is George Orwell ’why I write’. He talks about how as a writer, he writes against something and asks the question. I think he was writing it in the 1936, and I think that’s the point with the civil war in Spain, and Hitler is a growing power in Germany and so on. And the way that he writes is to write against something, to have something to protest against. The way that I read the text, he believes that gives his work extra value. And I think that’s the case with design as well, because you’re doing a service in a much stronger way. But, even if we’re not in these dire situations, design is still a way to understand who we are. Culture is what defines us as human beings, and design is part of culture and so on. You can kind of back track it that way.  It’s definitely a way to understand who we are, and I think that will always be important. It is really big because design criticism is about design, and design is everything almost. And it comes in so many different shapes and formats and intentions.  But, as an answer to your question; yes, design serves a bigger purpose in dire situations, and wars bring with them a lot of new inventions and ways of working. Especially for industrial design, wars have always proven to be really beneficial for the development. And posters help inform people and that’s basically what graphic design does, is communicate. So, yes, but I still think it’s important in the normal, in times of peace and so on.</p3>
<br>
<p3>While in times of peace, another thing that kind of introduced the value of the graphic designer to me again, form another side, was a discussion about the soft power that graphic designers have vs the hard power of politicians and CEO’s. The people of graphic design would sit with the soft power and the ability to choose your assignments, choose your work, choose your style and what you say with it. Do you think this is something that’s trendy to be more aware of now?</p>
<br>
<p>Right now I think we’re in a funny time of graphic design becasue after the mid-2000’s, where designers were really working as publishers, trying to understand who they were. You know, self-publshing was at a high at the end of the 2000’s. ’Forms of enquiry’, ’dot dot dot’, all these publications, we are not seeing it today. There is a new generation, I don’t know if you even call it a generation, but the Stewart Bailey’s aren’t prominent in this new wave of designers that are working now. So, even if they are still self-publishing, I feel as if designers are not as active as they were, perhaps ten years ago.</p3>
<br>
<p3>That would be the other side of this discussion that I’ve found. I mean I’m kind of testing the water here just and asking you, ’am I right, am I wrong?’. The other side, compared to this soft power, I mean the soft power article was calling for people to wake up and realise, what can you do? And then the other side of the discussion again says that people care too little about their own ability or don’t understand enough the ability they have within the profession. And that is why the discussion of graphic design kind of loses out, because people don’t understand their responsibility.I think that this self-publishing has been done now for some years, and people are thinking, ok, while self-publishing was a bit radical six or seven years ago, it’s not now. It’s just almost one of those things you are expected to do working as a graphic designer, working in the cultural field. And therefore, graphic designers working in the cultural field who always have a need to be inventive and push forward, aren’t doing it because it’s already been done. So, it’s a question of, ’what can I do instead?’.
And everything radical becomes normal.<p3>
<br>
<p>Exactly, and it’s as if people are searching for the next new thing to do, new way of publishing, new way of self-expression and unfortunately you see designers going into the art field instead, to have that desire fulfilled.</p3>
<br>
<p3>More and more people are suggested to do their Master in fine arts, after a Bachelor in graphic design. I know this in the Netherlands.</p>
<br>
<p>I can imagine that being the case. I think that’s a real shame because there lies an opportunity to develop the field and push forward into these outer limits of what we define as graphic design. It sounds as if I’m really negative now, I’m not, I actaully think we’re just at the starting point of something new.</p3>
<br>
<p3>A lot of schools are focusing less on printing, more on web design. They don’t know which direction to push us now because they also see the change. They don’t know if web design is right, but they certainly try to give us something that they didn’t give people before. So, at least you have something new, but the feeling of not really knowing which media you’re supposed to focus on is very present in all students.</p>
<br>
<p>That’s why I think we shouldn’t push people into the art field, but let them think conceptually within graphic design. As you would in arts, not necessarily choose the medium first but choose your idea first and then the medium that goes along with your idea. But web design can be so avant garde, so I think that is where the new self-publishing wave is going to come, if we’re going to call it the self-publishing wave.</p3>
<br>
<p3>I was thinking that’s where the real discussions for criticism will take place. I was looking for blogs, one was called something simple like ’art and design’, and they have up to 20,000 clicks in a day, and they collect and curate criticism from around the world. The only problem I can imagine is as soon as you go online, is that somebody would have to find you. Because otherwise you have the need for advertising, and advertising is what makes being online annoying and then it’s a viscious circle. How do you make what’s online available to everybody? I was thinking that a platform online for design criticism would be what it needs, but then you kind of meet yourself in the door immediately.<p3>
<br>
<p>I don’t have a good solution! I think, again like I just said, the format- understanding the idea before you choose the medium. Why should we have design criticism? I think that’s the most important question to answer, and then how, and then choose your medium.</p3>
<br>
<p3>I was also wondering, one thing that maybe more present in Norway than what I noticed in the Netherlands, maybe because I’m in art school, is the difference between the designers that design for the market, and the designers that design for the culture, and I think our two design awards, ’visuelt’ on one hand, and ’merket for god design’ represent two sides of graphic design maybe even more ’vakreste bok’.</p1>
<br>
<p>Visuelt is also quite commercial, but not as commercial as ’merket for god design’. ’merket for god design’ is by norsk designråd, who have focus on the more næringsliv. So, the things that they award there are the things that are benefitting the more financial sectors. While, Visuelt is more about the aesthetics but it’s still very commercial projects that win, and ’vakreste bok’ is the cultural field. I know designers that won’t submit things to Visuelt because it’s too commercial. They are not interested in the discourse that’s happening in Visuelt, and I totally understand that even if I believe that they all have value, because they represent different sides of the field and even if we’re going to attempt, in this art school setting, to dismiss the commercial aspect, that’s also a very important part of graphic design.</p3>
<br>
<p3>The reason I’m mostly asking is because as design criticism, graphic design criticism should be, like we talk about so many times, ‘including’ and put in a bigger setting. That it should also have room for not only criticism, as in direct criticism, but also opening and understanding. Both these fields of graphic design, which can be quite tricky sometimes seeing as they have a tendency to very much take a standpoint away from each other’s approach.<p3>
<br>
<p>But I think that’s something that happens a lot in the Netherlands, and a lot in Norway, while in England you have quite a lot of companies that work all over the field. OK RM is a really good example. So, even if there is this line, and people choose to practice in certain ways and with certain clients, it sometimes feels a bit unnecessary to be so pedantic in your practice. I think both of those sides can try to see that value in each other’s work more perhaps, but these divides have always existed and they always will, and they don’t only exist in design, they exist in the larger society as well. People have things that they consider to be more important and that they want.</p3>
<br>
<p3>We’re closing to an end, I think, but I’m curious how did you find your MA and what made you desire to do this?</p>
<br>
<p>I was looking through different MA’s because I wanted to develop my thought patterns. I did my Ba in fashion journalism, and I ended up writing mainly about design. Then I worked for a couple of years doing some marketing stuff, and writing on the side, and it just wasn’t doing it for me so I decided to do an MA and I found that MA because I knew that I wanted to go back to London, and it was just all of these pieces falling together for me. And the people who were running it were really clever people that I respected. The MA itself for me was an epiphany, to be a bit dramatic.</p3>
<br>
<p3>Do you think you have the ability, now that you’re back in Norway, I mean obviously you are still writing about criticism so you probably hope to bring it back.</p>
<br>
<p>Yes, I hope that there’s room for it but I’m not sure if there is yet. We’ll see.</p3>
